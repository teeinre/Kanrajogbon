create a clear, step-by-step user story and system logic flow for a platform where clients use a special "findertoken" to post high-budget finds. The documentation should be comprehensive and cover the perspectives of both the Admin and the Client.

Core Requirements:

Admin Configuration: Describe the actions the Admin can take from a central dashboard:

The ability to define a specific dollar amount that serves as the threshold for a "high budget" find (e.g., $1,000).

The ability to set the number of findertokens required to post a find that meets or exceeds this threshold.

Client Posting Workflow: Detail the complete user journey for a client attempting to post a find. This flow must include:

The client inputs the details of their find, including the budget.

The system's initial check: it must compare the client's entered budget with the "high budget" threshold set by the Admin.

Conditional Logic:

If the client's budget is below the threshold, the system should allow the post to be submitted without any token deduction.

If the client's budget is equal to or above the threshold, the system must proceed with a token check.

Token Deduction & Payment Logic:

The system must look up the client's current findertoken balance.

If the client's balance is sufficient, the system should deduct the required amount of findertokens and successfully post the find.

If the client's balance is insufficient, a modal popup must appear. The modal should explain that a findertoken purchase is required to complete the high-budget post.

Within the modal, the client must be able to specify the number of findertokens they wish to purchase.

Upon confirmation, the system must initiate a payment process (e.g., via a payment gateway like Paystack), taking the client to a dedicated payment page.

After a successful payment, the system should automatically credit the purchased findertokens to the client's wallet.

Finally, after the wallet has been successfully credited, the system must automatically re-process the original post submission, deduct the required findertokens, and then publish the find.
