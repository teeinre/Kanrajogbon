FinderTokens

They are not currency, not legal tender, and hold no monetary value outside the platform.

FinderTokens are:

Non-refundable

Non-transferable

Expire after six (6) months from issuance 

And 20 Findertokens are awarded to each finder monthly

The expiry and non-refundable nature of FinderTokens are final and binding.


Contracts & Escrow

All contracts are fixed budget that can be agreed on between Finders and Clients.

Clients must deposit funds into escrow before a Finder begins work.

Escrow funds are released:

Automatically if no dispute is raised within the inspection period (48 hours).

Upon Client approval of deliverables.

Following dispute resolution (see Section 4).


Finality Clause: Once escrow is released, payment is irreversible except in proven fraud.
