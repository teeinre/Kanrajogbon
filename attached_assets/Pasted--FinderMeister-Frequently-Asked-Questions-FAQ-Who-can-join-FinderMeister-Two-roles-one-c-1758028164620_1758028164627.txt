 
FinderMeister — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Who can join FinderMeister?
Two roles, one community (you can be both):
Clients — Anyone who needs something sourced or a task executed: individuals, students, small businesses/brands, event planners, NGOs, and Nigerians in the diaspora. Clients pay safely via escrow and can optionally boost requests with FinderTokens (required for high-budget finds > ■50,000).

Finders — Resourceful people who can locate items/services or carry out tasks reliably: students, side-hustlers, personal shoppers, couriers, fixers, and professionals.

Do I need technical expertise or special skills?
No. You don’t need coding or advanced skills. If you’re good at locating items (gadgets, accommodation, groceries, pharmaceuticals, thrift) or handling tasks (errands, delivery, event setup), you qualify.

What exactly is a Find?
A Find can be either:
Sourcing — Helping a client locate a product, service, or opportunity (e.g., apartment, sneakers, textbooks, medications, tickets).
Task Execution — Carrying out an activity on behalf of a client (e.g., groceries, couriering, event setup).

How do payments work?
⦁	Client pays the contract fee upfront through Flutterwave escrow.
⦁	Flutterwave adds a small processing fee (1.4% local, capped at ■2,000; 3.8% for international) — on the client’s side.
⦁	FinderMeister holds funds until completion.
⦁	FinderMeister deducts 15% per contract.
⦁	Finder receives the remaining 85% directly to their account.

Example: Client pays ■20,000 (+ processing fee). FinderMeister charges ■3,000 (15%). Finder gets ■17,000.

Is my money safe?
Yes. All payments are held in escrow until the client confirms delivery.

What if there’s a dispute?

FinderMeister has a dispute resolution system. If a complaint is raised, we investigate and only release funds once it’s resolved fairly.

When do I get paid?
Once the client approves completion, payments are split automatically. Funds are sent to your bank account (Flutterwave may apply a small payout fee, e.g., ■45).

Can I join from outside Nigeria?
At launch, FinderMeister is Nigeria-first. Clients abroad can still pay through Flutterwave, while Nigerian Finders complete local finds.

What types of finds are popular?
Groceries & Errands: shopping, delivery runs. Pharmaceuticals: medications and health supplies. Fashion & Thrift: clothes, sneakers, accessories. Tech & Gadgets: phones, laptops, electronics.
Real Estate: hostels, apartments, short lets.
Events & Entertainment: tickets, logistics.
Everyday Tasks: courier services, school errands, small repairs.

How much does it cost to register?
Registration is free. FinderMeister only charges 15% per contract once you earn.

What are FinderTokens?
FinderTokens are platform credits used to apply for finds and boost visibility.

How do FinderTokens work for Finders?
⦁	Each application costs 10 FinderTokens.
⦁	Every Finder receives 20 FinderTokens free monthly.
⦁	Additional tokens can be purchased to apply for more finds.

How do FinderTokens work for Clients?
⦁	Optional for boosting a find (makes it more visible).
⦁	Required for high-budget finds above ■50,000.

Do FinderTokens replace money?
No. FinderTokens are not cash. They are credits for applying/boosting. Payments are always made in Naira (■) via escrow.

Why use FinderTokens?
⦁	To reduce spam (Finders apply more carefully).
⦁	To show seriousness (Clients boost or stake tokens).
⦁	To keep the marketplace balanced and active.

What is gamification on FinderMeister?

Gamification makes FinderMeister more fun and rewarding by adding game-like features for Finders. Instead of only earning money, you also rise through ranks, earn recognition, and build credibility.

How does gamification work for Finders?

⦁	Pathfinder — Completed first successful finds.
⦁	Seeker — Gaining trust with multiple completed finds.
⦁	Meister — Highly trusted, proven Finder with excellent client reviews.
⦁	Grandmeister — The elite top-tier Finder: consistent, reliable, and top rated.

Why gamify FinderMeister?
⦁	Makes the Finder journey exciting and rewarding.
⦁	Motivates Finders to stay consistent and professional.
⦁	Builds trust by showing clients the rank and credibility of each Finder.
⦁	Creates a sense of achievement beyond just money.
